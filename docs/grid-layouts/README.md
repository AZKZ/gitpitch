# Grid Layouts

Grid layouts is an innovative system that replicates the layout precision of traditional drag-and-drop solutions directly within the markdown for your slide decks. Using a simple markdown syntax you can:

1. **Drag** to size a block of content on your slide, then
2. **Drop** to position that block anywhere on the slide.

The grid layouts system can be used to size and position every type of content supported by GitPitch slide decks, no limits.
