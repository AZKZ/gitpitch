For **slide decks within private repositories** dedicated PITCHME.yaml settings files directly alongside PITCHME.md are required. If no dedicated settings file is found for a deck, all attempts to render that deck online are halted.

!> This private repo halting policy forces you to be explicit about custom settings to prevent the accidental exposure of private content.
