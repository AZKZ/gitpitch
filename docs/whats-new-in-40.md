# What's New in GitPitch 4.0

The 4.0 release represents the fruits of listening to and learning from my users over the past 4 years. It has been a phenomenal journey, challenge, and education. My sincerest thanks goes out to each and every one of you who has participated along the way.

### Free Trial

With this release all barriers to getting started have been removed. No sign-up required. No credit card needed. And no time limits on your trial. It could not be easier to take GitPitch 4.0 for a test drive. Start your free trial [right now](/free-trial.md).

### GitPitch Desktop

The [Desktop App](/desktop/README.md) has been given a makeover. A major makeover.  With a new user interface, improved navigation, an **embedded markdown editor**, and built-in help. The new desktop experience is a joy. The app is also at the heart of exciting new features including [Grid Layouts](#grid-layouts).

### Grid Layouts

At its core the GitPitch 4.0 redesign is built around a brand new grid layouts system. This innovative system replicates the layout precision of traditional **drag-and-drop** solutions directly within the markdown for your slide decks. Giving you pixel-perfect control over the positioning and sizing of your slide content. You won't believe it [until you see it](/grid-layouts/drag-and-drop.md)!

### Grid Native 

GitPitch has always supported rich slide content. From basic markdown, including text, lists, and images to more sophisticated and interactive content including live code presenting powered by *Markdown Widget Syntax*. In 4.0 widgets have been upgraded to become [100% Grid Native](/grid-layouts/native-widgets.md).

### Synchronized Stacks

Rendering simple list content remains a core feature for most presentation tools. With the release of [Grid Stacks](/grid-layouts/stacks) 4.0 introduces brand new rendering behaviors for rich slide content. Including code, diagrams, videos, math formulas and more. These behaviors combined with **slide content synchronizations** across both stack and list content are [a joy to behold](/grid-layouts/synchronization).

### Modular Markdown

With GitPitch you manage your slide decks and training materials the same way you manage code. Your slide markdown is modular by design. And natively under Git version control. In 4.0 modular markdown support has taken **giant leaps forward** with the introduction of [Markdown Injection](/modular-markdown/injection.md), [Markdown Variables](/modular-markdown/variables.md), [Markdown Globals](/modular-markdown/globals.md), and [Markdown Templates](/modular-markdown/templates.md). If you are building training or course materials these exciting new modularization features are a must see.

### And There's More

As you browse these docs you'll find lots more new features. Including [Grid Fit](/grid-layouts/fit-text.md) for content. Grid [Animations](/grid-layouts/animations.md). Among many other delights. I simply encourage you to enjoy these discoveries as you familiarize yourself with GitPitch 4.0.
