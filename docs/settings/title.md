# Title Setting

### Purpose

The `title` setting lets you set a custom HTML title for your slide deck.

### Syntax

```yaml
title : "Do More With Markdown"
```

### Details

?> Settings are activated using the [PITCHME.yaml](/conventions/pitchme-yaml.md) for your slide deck.

When activated, a custom `title` for your presentation has the following affects:

- Displays a custom title for the presentation in search-engine results
- Defines a custom title for the presentation in the browser toolbar or tab
- Provides a custom title for the presentation when it is added to favorites

For example, here is a sample custom title set in a **PITCHME.yaml** settings file:

```yaml
title : "Elixir Conf Keynote 2021"
```
