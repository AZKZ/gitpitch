# Favicon Setting

### Purpose

The `favicon` setting lets you activate a custom [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) for your slide deck.

### Syntax

```yaml
favicon : assets/img/fav.ico
```

### Details

?> Settings are activated using the [PITCHME.yaml](/conventions/pitchme-yaml.md) for your slide deck.

The `favicon` setting supports both relative and absolute paths to the image file. When activated, your favicon is used as a website icon, tab icon, shortcut icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon for your slide deck.
