# Language Setting

#### Purpose

The `lang` setting lets you declare the language of your slide deck to assist search engines and browsers.

#### Syntax

```yaml
lang : "es"
```

### Details

?> Settings are activated using the [PITCHME.yaml](/conventions/pitchme-yaml.md) for your slide deck.

When activated, this setting sets the lang property on the top-level `<html lang="es">` element for your slide deck. By default, this property is not set.
