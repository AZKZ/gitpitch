# Settings

The appearance and behavior of GitPitch slide decks can be manipulated using custom settings. By convention, custom settings are maintained within a [PITCHME.yaml](/conventions/pitchme-yaml.md) file.

Any *settings* that are directly related to a specific feature are documented directly in the corresponding feature guide. A few standalone settings are also supported. These standalone settings are documented in the following guides:

- [Title Setting](/settings/title.md)
- [Language Setting](/settings/lang.md)
- [Favicon Setting](/settings/favicon.md)
- [Background Setting](/settings/background.md)
- [Twitter Card Setting](/settings/twitter-card.md)
- [Google Analytics Setting](/settings/google-analytics.md)
