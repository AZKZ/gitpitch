GitPitch CICD is a continuous integration executor that can be used within your existing CI/CD pipelines to auto-generate PDF, PPTX, and/or JPG screenshots of slide decks found in any Git repository.

Like any CI/CD pipeline job, GitPitch CICD can be launched in response to typical events such as a commit, tag, or release on target branches and repositories.

The steps to activate GitPitch CICD within your pipeline are dependent on your CI/CD provider. The following providers are currently supported:

- [CircleCI](cicd/circleci.md)
- [GitLab CI/CD](cicd/gitlab-cicd.md)
- [GitHub Actions](cicd/github-actions.md)

Follow any of the links above to find provider specific lauch instructions.
