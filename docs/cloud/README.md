Any slide deck created using [GitPitch Desktop](/desktop/) can be published and shared online at **gitpitch.com**. Publishing is achieved by a simple `git-push` to a *public* or *private* repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

The following online publishing options are available for GitPitch slide decks:

1. [Public Slide Decks using Public Repos](/cloud/public-slide-decks.md)
1. [Public Slide Decks using Private Repos](/cloud/public-slide-decks.md)
1. [Private Slide Decks using Private Repos](/cloud/private-slide-decks.md)
1. [Password-protected Slide Decks using Private Repos](/cloud/password-protected-slide-decks.md)

When publishing slide decks online, custom settings in the [PITCHME.yaml](/conventions/pitchme-yaml.md) for a deck are used to control visibility and access. These settings are detailed in the cloud publishing guides that follow.

Beyond public, private, and password-protected slide decks GitPitch Cloud also supports these additional publishing features for slide decks online:

1. [Publish Audio Slide Decks](/cloud/audio-slide-decks.md)
1. [Publish Survey Slide Decks](/cloud/survey-slide-decks.md)
