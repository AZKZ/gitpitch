# PITCHME.md

If you have ever worked on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket you may be familiar with the **README.md** convention. Any README.md markdown file found within a Git repository is automatically rendered as nicely formatted documentation. This convention gives developers a simple and convenient way to document any project.

GitPitch introduces a brand new convention called the **PITCHME.md** convention. Any PITCHME.md markdown file found within a Git repository is automatically rendered by [GitPitch Desktop](/desktop/) and the [GitPitch Cloud](/cloud/) as a modern, responsive slideshow presentation.

The PITCHME.md convention gives developers a uniquely powerful way to develop, manage, and publish slide decks and training materials using best practices under Git version control.

!> PITCHME.md markdown files also support modular markdown [includes, injection and templates](/modular-markdown/).
