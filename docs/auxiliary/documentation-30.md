# Documentation 3.0 - Deprecated

GitPitch 4.0 is the [current release](/whats-new-in-40.md).

Support for GitPitch 3.0 has ended. For now the 3.0  documentation is still available [here](https://gitpitch.com/3.0/docs-30.zip). After downloading the 3.0 documentation bundle you can view the docs under a local web server. For example:

```sh
$ unzip docs-30.zip
$ cd gitpitch-docs
$ python -m http.server
```
