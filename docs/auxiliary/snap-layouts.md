# Snap Layouts 3.0 - Deprecated

GitPitch 4.0 was released in September, 2020. The 4.0 release introduces a brand new layout system for GitPitch markdown presentations called [Grid Layouts](/grid-layouts/README.md). This new layout system is now the default layout system for GitPitch slide decks.

!> All new GitPitch slide decks should use the grid layouts system and 4.0 syntax per these docs.

The old snap layouts layout system is now *deprecated* and should no longer be used. Old snap layouts syntax is not supported within 4.0 slide decks. See the [Upgrading to 4.0 Guide](/upgrading-to-40.md) for further details.
